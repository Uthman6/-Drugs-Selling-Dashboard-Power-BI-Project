# -Drugs-Selling-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
I designed this interactive Drugs Selling Dashboard using Power BI to analyze key business insights from a pharmacy sales dataset.

The dashboard provides a clear overview of:
💊 Total Selling Price by Category (Antibiotics, Allergy Relief, Digestive Health, etc.)
📊 Profit Gain by Medicine Name
📦 Total Quantity of Medicines in Stock
💰 Cost and Selling Price Distribution
🏪 Medicine and Supplier Performance


Through data visualization, this project helps in:
	•	Monitoring drug sales trends.
	•	Identifying the most profitable medicines.
	•	Managing stock efficiently.
	•	Supporting better decision-making in pharmaceutical sales.

Tools Used: Power BI | Data Cleaning | DAX | Visualization Design

This project improved my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights — a key skill every data analyst should master.
